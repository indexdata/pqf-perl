Description:  Perl extension for parsing PQF (Prefix Query Format)
 This library provides a parser for PQF (Prefix Query Format), an ugly
 but precise string format for expressing Z39.50 Type-1 queries.  This
 format is widely used behind the scenes of Z39.50 applications, and is
 also used extensively with test-harness programs such as the YAZ
 command-line client, yaz-client.  A few particularly misguided
 souls have been known to type it by hand.
 .
 Unlike PQF itself, this module
 is simple to use.  Create a parser object, then pass PQF strings
 into its parse() method to yield parse-trees.  The trees are made
 up of nodes whose types are subclasses of
 Net::Z3950::PQF::Node.
 and have names of the form
 Net::Z3950::PQF::somethingNode.  You may find it helpful to use
 Data::Dumper to visualise the structure of the returned
 parse-trees.
